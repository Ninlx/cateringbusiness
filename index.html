																				<p>On behalf of my family and our guests I would like to offer my thanks to the 2 lovely people who came to our home as cook and server for the evening of the 18th. They made the night with their bright and cheery disposition, and their very genuine desire to make sure everyone at our party was happy and enjoying themselves. To say these lovely people went the extra mile is an understatement, as nothing was too much trouble. Please pass on to them my apologies as they were unaware that after working in their home country for some time my language skills allowed me to understand their conversations in the kitchen, where it became so very obvious they were genuinely trying to make it a special night.</p>

																				<p>Thank you so much for your assistance in organising Saturday night. The food was delicious and the ladies were excellent in the kitchen and serving the food. An extra bonus was the kitchen was left spotless so we didn't wake up to a big mess.

We will definitely recommend you to friends and family, as all who came on Saturday were also impressed.</p>

																				<p>Just wanted to let you know how impressed we were with the food and service today Thursday 20th June 2013. The presentation and quality of all the platters was fantastic and the service provided by your staff member was very professional, helpful and helped our event run smoothly. We gave the cheque to your staff member to pass on to you- unfortunately we were unable to deposit it into the bank prior to the event as we don't currently have the facilities to do this. I look forward to hopefully using your service again in the future. Thank you.</p>

																				<p>Despite short notice, Jeff and his team put on an amazing spread for a visiting Cabinet Minister and an office of hungry department staff for National Child Protection Week 2018. Michael was friendly, patient and an excellent resource to educate event organisers around catering planning. Great value for money compared with other catering companies was a plus too. Highly recommended.</p>
